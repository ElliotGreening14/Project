            <h3>Should the Lakers make a move for Beal or AD?</h3>
            <p>The Los Angeles Lakers relative to expectation have had an okay start to the 2018/19 NBA Season.
                However with the reality of results needing to improve in order to reach a respectable level in the playoffs,
                some people have suggested that is time that the Lakers Organisation makes a big trade move in order to bolster 
                their roster for the push for the post-season.</p>

            <h3>Butler and his perfect fit with Embiid and Simmons</h3>
            <p>The Philadelphia 76ers have been on a tear since their trade for Jimmy Butler. No longer in their famous process,
                The eastern conference contenders have really announced their intentions this season and going forward with their franchise.
                They want to win a title, and Jimmy Butler may have been the perfect asset to go along side thier young superstar-led core.
                A profiecient scorer, lockdown defender and clutch at the end of games, Butler is revelling in his role in Philly.</p>

            <h3>Warriors dynasty on the verge of ending?</h3>
            <p>The speculation continues to surround Kevin Durant, the confrontation with Draymond Green continues to linger
                like a bad smell around the organisation, despite the endless amount of press conferences and player interviews to convince
                media members otherwise. The performances on the court haven't faired much better, as the team continues to slump and now finally
                getting their obvious leader Stephen Curry back.</p>
