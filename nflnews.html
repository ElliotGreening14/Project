            <p>After learning of running back Kareem Hunt's recent domestic assault, the Kansas City Chiefs
                released the player with immediate effect. 
                Allegations of Hunt's disgression surfaced after an online video showing the player in a Hotel lobby,
                assualting and kicking an un-named woman in the earlier hours of the morning. An investigation was 
                launched by the NFL regarding the matter and it has led to immediate dismissal of Hunt from the franchises roster.</p>

            <h3>The Patriots dynasty perhaps not nearing its end</h3>
            <p>Quietly the Patriots have once again gone about their business. With the ever present Bill Belliceck
                and seemingly youthful 41-year-old Tom Brady, the rocky start to the season is a distant memory as the Pats sit in 
                2nd spot in the AFC. Along with the choas surrounding Kansas City, a relatively lax finishing schedule looks set to 
                lead the Boston franchise to the number #1 seed in the AFC.</p>

            <h3>Kelvin Benjamin no longer part of Buffalo Bills</h3>
            <p>Wide Reciever Kelvin Benjamin's NFL Career is spiralling out of control after another franchise
                has given up on the troubled wideout. The Bills spent a 3rd round pick acquiring the former Panther
                but now they have released a statement saying they wanted to move in a different direction rather than
                pick up the end of seaosn contract extension for Benjamin.</p>
