            <h3>No Aguero, No Sterling, No problem for Man City</h3>
            <p>After defeating Bournemouth comfortably, Man City had another away tie in the premier league midweek and really 
                showed their strength in depth as they dropped both top scorer-Sergio Aguero and star man Raheem Sterling and were still
                good for 3 points as they kept their title charge on track, goals from Leroy Sane and Riyad Mahrez were enough
                to seal the victory for the away side.</p>

            <h3>Liverpool take a famous and bizzare victroy over rivals Everton</h3>
            <p>It's almost too difficult to describe as the Merseyside Derby saw one of the craziest finishes to a game in recent memory
                The game locked at 0-0 looked all the world to finish a draw and give a point to each Merseyside squad.
                However, with literally no time left on the clock Van Dijk spiralled a scuffed volley into the air that looked to be travelling over the Everton bar.
                Before a moment of madness saw goalkeeper Jordan Pickford try to pluck it from the sky, fumble it to Divock Origi who headed in a close effort to win the game for the reds.

            <h3>Will Mourinho be in the helm much longer</h3>
            <p>Pressure continues to mount on head coach Jose Mourinho at Old trafford as his side were once again underwhelming
                in their weekend draw with Southampton, despite going two goals down and clawing their way back to level, the team performed
                in a lacklustre manner in the second half which saw the game flicker out of action and the body langugage of players suggested
                the dissapointment at the result for the Man Utd team.</p>

                        <p> An action packed weekend in the English Premier League, saw once again the top teams proving their dominance,
                            alongside a brilliant Super Sundy full of derbies that will long be etched in the memory of Football fans. Liverpool defeated
                            Everton in the merseyside derby with one of the most bizzare goals to ever cap off the tie. Manchester City were surpsingly threatened
                            early in their game against Bournemouth but prevailed once more through the intervention of Raheem Sterling who continues
                            his blistering form for the Champions. </p>
