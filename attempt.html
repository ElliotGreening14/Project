                        <p> After learning of running back Kareem Hunt's recent domestic assault, the Kansas City Chiefs
                            released the player with immediate effect. 
                            Allegations of Hunt's disgression surfaced after an online video showing the player in a Hotel lobby,
                            assualting and kicking an un-named woman in the earlier hours of the morning. An investigation was 
                            launched by the NFL regarding the matter and it has led to immediate dismissal of Hunt from the franchises roster.

                        <p> The Los Angeles Lakers relative to expectation have had an okay start to the 2018/19 NBA Season.
                            However with the reality of results needing to improve in order to reach a respectable level in the playoffs,
                            some people have suggested that is time that the Lakers Organisation makes a big trade move in order to bolster 
                            their roster for the push for the post-season.</p>

                            over the future direction, pulled out an unlikely 13-10 victory over the predicted Super Bowl-bound New
                            Orleans Saints. A defensive masterclass was showcased to NFL Fans, as the MVP-leading candidate Drew Brees
                            had a low-par performance and threw an unlikely and untimely interception to seal the win for the Cowboys.</p>

                            alongside a brilliant Super Sundy full of derbies that will long be etched in the memory of Football fans. Liverpool defeated
                            Everton in the merseyside derby with one of the most bizzare goals to ever cap off the tie. Manchester City were surpsingly threatened
                            early in their game against Bournemouth but prevailed once more through the intervention of Raheem Sterling who continues
                            his blistering form for the Champions. </p>
